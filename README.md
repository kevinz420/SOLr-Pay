> Connecting payments across the Solr System.

SOLr Pay is a decentralized P2P payment protocol on the [Solana](https://solana.com/) blockchain that aims to improve the user experience of crypto payments. Anyone can create a customized Solr profile, quickly access other Solana wallets in their friend network, and send casual payments with a note, all on-chain.

## Local Development
Codebase is a monorepo with the frontend interface in the **app** folder and smart contracts in the **programs/solrpay** folder. Install the needed dependencies by running `npm install` in both the root and app directories.
## Source Code
The source code included is the final production version of the protocol. Eventual changes (smart contracts updates, bug fixes, etc.) will be applied through subsequent merge requests.
